# Events Management React APP

Front-end React.js project, designed to simulate an event's management system.

Users can search events by location or name of events, dive into articles, and connect via contact form directly with the application managers.  
It allows event creators with tools to manage their events. From creating, editing, to deleting events with the inclusion of image uploads for events as well as organizers.


This App is part of a Full-Stack project. The Back-end Development has been created using Node.js/Express, Prisma[ORM], Sentry[Performance monitoring & error tracking], AuthO[Authentication and authorization services].

NOTE:
*This app has been deployed for portfolio viewing, however its features to create, edit, delete, and contact have been disable to avoid spam and changes to the intial database [these are set to be used with authorization token].  The deployment has been modified and set up to view as `current user`.*
